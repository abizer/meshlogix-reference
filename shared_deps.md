# Plan

We will create two main files:

1. `main.py`: This is the backend file which uses FastAPI and SQLite. The file will define the API endpoints that our frontend will interact with. It will also handle the database operations.
2. `index.html`: This is the frontend file which uses ReactJS. The file will contain the user interface and JavaScript code to interact with the backend.

## Backend (main.py)

The backend will expose the following RESTful API endpoints:
1. `GET /status`: Retrieve all status updates.
2. `POST /status`: Create a new status update.
3. `GET /status/{author}`: Retrieve all status updates from a specific author.
4. `GET /status/apartment/{apartment}`: Retrieve all status updates from a specific apartment.

### Data Schema for SQLite
The SQLite database will have a single table named `status_updates` with the following schema:

- `timestamp`: TEXT
- `author`: TEXT
- `apartment`: INTEGER
- `post`: TEXT

### Functions
- `create_db()`: This function will create the SQLite database and table if they do not exist.
- `get_status()`, `post_status()`, `get_status_by_author()`, `get_status_by_apartment()`: These functions will handle the API endpoint requests.

The backend will run on a uvicorn server listening on port 8080.

## Frontend (index.html)

The frontend will consist of a single HTML file with embedded ReactJS code. It will contain the following DOM elements:

- A form with input fields for `name`, `apartment number`, and `status update`.
- A list to display the status updates along with the author's name and apartment number.

React components will be created for each of these elements. 

The JavaScript functions will use the Fetch API to interact with the backend.

### React Components

1. `StatusForm`: A form for submitting status updates.
2. `StatusList`: A component to display a list of status updates.
3. `StatusItem`: A component to display a single status update.

### Functions

1. `submitStatus()`: This function will be called when the status form is submitted. It will send a POST request to the backend to create a new status update.
2. `filterStatusByAuthor(author)`, `filterStatusByApartment(apartment)`: These functions will be called when the user clicks on an author's name or apartment number. They will send GET requests to the backend to retrieve status updates from a specific author or apartment.
3. `getStatusUpdates()`: This function will be called to get all status updates. It will send a GET request to the backend.

The frontend will communicate with the backend via standard REST API interactions. There won't be any user authentication or account management features as they are not required by the prompt.
